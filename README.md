# Digital Clock

This is a simple web application that displays the current time along with the date. It also showcases the usage of the Bootstrap framework for styling and responsiveness.

## Features

- Real-time display of the current time and date.
- Navbar with navigation links and a search form.
- Hero unit (jumbotron) with a brief introduction and a call-to-action button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS (Bootstrap): Styling framework for enhanced design and responsiveness.
- JavaScript: Programming language for dynamic functionality.

## Getting Started

To use or modify this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/current-time-display.git`
2. Open the project folder.
3. Launch the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the web page, you will see the current time displayed dynamically. The time is updated every second, providing an accurate representation of the current time. The date is also displayed below the time.

The navigation bar at the top allows you to access different sections of the web page. The "Home" link is selected by default, indicating the current active page. The "Link" and "Dropdown" links are placeholders and can be customized to navigate to other sections or pages of your choice.

The search form in the navigation bar is available for searching purposes. You can enter a search query and click the "Search" button to perform a search (currently not functional).

The hero unit (jumbotron) section provides a brief description of the application's purpose. It highlights the availability of time display for different countries and includes a call-to-action button labeled "Browse Times." The button can be customized with a link to the desired page or functionality.

## Customization

You can customize the project by making changes to the following files:

- `index.html`: Modify the content, update navigation links, or add new sections.
- `styles.css`: Adjust the styling, colors, or layout according to your preferences.
- `script.js`: Customize the time display or add additional functionality using JavaScript.
